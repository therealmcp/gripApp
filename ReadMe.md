## Using Grip

To use grip you must....  Is it deployed to heroku?  Do we have a link?  Or should we instruct users to download expo, then run npm start in their terminal and scan QIR Code?

## User Authentication

## Graphs

Our graphs were created using React-Native-Chart-Kit.  This is an npm packagage and we utilize both line and progress graphs. These graphs have functionality with expo, which we are utilzing to display our our application. Documenation for React-Native-Chart-Kit can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-chart-kit
